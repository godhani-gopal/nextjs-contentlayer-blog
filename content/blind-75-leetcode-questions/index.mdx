# LeetCode Blind 75: Comprehensive Guide and Solutions

## Introduction

The LeetCode Blind 75 list is a curated set of 75 problems that are essential for coding interview preparation. This guide categorizes each problem by topic, providing descriptions, difficulty levels, and links to both the LeetCode problem pages and detailed solutions.

**Example 1:**

**Input:** `nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 9{:java}`  
**Output:** `[0,1]{:java}`  
**Explanation:** Because `nums[0] + nums[1] == 9{:java}`, we return `[0, 1]{:java}`.

**Example 2:**

**Input:** nums = [3,2,4], target = 6  
**Output:** [1,2]

**Example 3:**

**Input:** nums = [3,3], target = 6  
**Output:** [0,1]

**Constraints:**

- `2 <= nums.length <= 10^4{:java}`
- `-10^9 <= nums[i] <= 10^9{:java}`
- `-10^9 <= target <= 10^9{:java}`
- **Only one valid answer exists.**

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] nums, int target) {
        Map<Integer, Integer> map = new HashMap<>();
        
        for (int i = 0; i < nums.length; i++) {
            int currentValue = nums[i];
            int complement = target - currentValue;
            if (map.containsKey(complement)) {
                return new int[] { map.get(complement), i };
            }
            map.put(currentValue, i);
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```
